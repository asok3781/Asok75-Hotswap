# Asok75v2-Hotswap
This is a PCB designed to fit in the TX75v2 and be a replacement PCB for this keyboard, integrating Kailh hotswap sockets into the board.

This PCB uses [QMK firmware](https://github.com/asok3781/qmk_firmware/tree/asok/keyboards/asok/asok75hs) and a [VIA definition](asok75hsViaDefinition) has also been created to easily customise the layout of the keyboard.

This PCB uses QMK compatible side-firing LEDs to keep the underglow of the original PCB bright.
